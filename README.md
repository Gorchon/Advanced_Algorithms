# Design of Advanced Algorithms - Course Repository

Welcome to the repository for the "Design of Advanced Algorithms" course. This repository contains all the materials, code, and notes related to the class, which covers advanced topics in algorithm design and analysis.

## Course Overview

The "Design of Advanced Algorithms" course delves into a variety of advanced topics beyond introductory algorithmic techniques. This course is designed for students who already have a solid foundation in basic algorithms and are looking to deepen their understanding and ability to solve more complex computational problems. Throughout this course, we will explore several key areas, including but not limited to:

### Key Topics Covered:
- **Advanced Data Structures**: Exploration of data structures such as Fibonacci heaps, splay trees, and dynamic trees, which are crucial for efficient data manipulation.
- **Network Flows**: Study of algorithms for solving flow problems in networks, including maximum flow, minimum cost flow, and bipartite matching.
- **Linear Programming**: Introduction to linear programming with a focus on simplex, interior-point, and ellipsoid algorithms, and their applications.
- **Approximation Algorithms**: Techniques for finding near-optimal solutions to NP-hard problems using greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, and linear programming relaxations.
- **Online Algorithms**: Algorithms designed to handle problems where data is received sequentially, including the ski rental problem and paging.
- **Computational Geometry**: Algorithms for spatial data, including convex hulls, line-segment intersection, and Voronoi diagrams.
- **Streaming Algorithms**: Techniques for processing large data streams efficiently, focusing on sketching and counting distinct elements.
- **Parallel and External Memory Algorithms**: Optimization of algorithms in parallel computing environments and minimizing access costs in hierarchical memory systems.

## Repository Structure

- **Lectures**: Contains notes and resources from the lectures, organized by topic.
- **Assignments**: Problem sets and projects assigned throughout the course.
- **Code**: Sample implementations of algorithms discussed in class.
- **Projects**: A collection of larger projects that explore advanced topics in greater depth, often involving research or practical application.
